# Welcome!

The goal of this document is to **help new Sokol-Hessner Lab (SHLab) members get set up** quickly and easily. Note that this website is hosted via GitHub, making it easy for existing lab members to edit and improve upon this document! If you're new, don't worry about that yet - just follow the instructions below to get started. 

## The short version

Send an email to [Peter](mailto:peter.sokol-hessner@du.edu) with...
- Your google email.
- Your DU email.
- Your GitHub account info.
- Your information for the website (see below).

... and he will add you to...
- the lab Slack and email lists.
- the lab GitHub organization.
- the secure drives.
- the important lab Google documents/calendars.
- the website.

For more information about how & why to do the above, keep on reading!

## Communication

The lab uses two main ways to communicate, plus a few others. 

### 1. Slack

There are two [Slack](www.slack.com) workspaces[^1] to join. 

1. The **SHLab slack** is for most daily communication. The slack workspace has channels for general communication, interesting "good reads" that lab members find, social interactions, research projects (each project has its own channel), direct messages between specific lab members, and more. **To be added to the slack workspace**, email peter.sokol-hessner@du.edu with the email address you'd like to use (typically, your name@du.edu address).
2. The **DU PSYC Coders Slack** is for people in or affiliated with the DU Psychology department who use programming to conduct their research. The workspace has channels for e.g., `R`, `python`, `MATLAB`, and more. 

#### Slack Settings

Slack works best when everyone's on it, and people are relatively responsive. To this end...

1. Join the lab Slack using a username that is based on your real name (i.e., your full name, your initials, or some combination thereof). 
2. If you are an active member of the lab, **please install the Slack application** and then **enable notifications** in Slack on your computer _and_ any digital devices (i.e., phone) that you regularly use.
3. Once installed, please **configure your account** with a representative photo of yourself, your full name, your pronouns, a brief blurb about yourself & your lab role, and any other information in the Slack profile that'd be helpful. 
4. Join Slack channels related to your work and role in the lab, and participate! 

### 2. Email

We have two lab email lists: shlab-general@du.edu and shlab-core@du.edu. To be added to these lists, please send your name@du.edu email to peter.sokol-hessner@du.edu. 

These lists are used for forwarding email announcements, and occasionally for lab events. _shlab-general_ is meant for anyone & everyone within the department of psychology who is interested in things that the S-H Lab may be discussing or doing. _shlab-core_ is meant only for 'core' members of the lab (graduate students, undergraduate RAs, etc).

### 3. Other communication

Lab members are also generally on **[Twitter](www.twitter.com)**. Lab members are encouraged to join twitter and follow other lab members, and, when applicable, share interesting or relevant tweets they find on science, research, or whatever. Peter's Twitter is [@p1sh](www.twitter.com/p1sh), and the lab's is [@ItsTheSHLab](https://twitter.com/ItsTheShlab).

We have **weekly lab meetings** during the academic quarter[^2]. All active lab members are expected to come to lab meetings and occasionally present/lead lab meeting. Lab meetings are typically scheduled immediately prior to each quarter (taking into account members' schedules). The goal is that lab meetings are helpful! Think about things you'd like feedback on, deadlines that'd be useful to you (to help you accomplish something on time, whether that be in your research, classes, or something else), and can be formal or informal presentations, guided discussions, or 'journal clubs' in which we present and discuss recent exciting research on emotion and decision-making. 

## Files and Documents

### 1. Code

The lab uses [GitHub](www.github.com) for all project- and lab-related scripts, functions, etc. We use GitHub to facilitate collaboration, documentation, backup, and storage. We believe this is a tool that every psychological scientist should learn to use, and **require all lab members who are working on or producing code to use GitHub**. 

If you don't know how to use GitHub, we recommend beginning at [Start Your Lab](www.startyourlab.com) (started by lab alumnus [Ari Dyckovsky!](www.aridyckovsky.com)), specifically the [Docs](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs) page. Read and complete the steps listed in the Setup and Tutorial pages. You may find the information on the [Text Editors](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs/text-editors) and [Glossary](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs/glossary) pages helpful.

Along the way, you'll need to...
- Create a [GitHub account](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs/github-accounts)
- Join the [SHLab's GitHub](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs/github-organizations) (by sharing the GitHub username or email you used to set up your account with Peter)
- Download and set up [GitHub Desktop](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs/github-desktop) and a [text editor](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs/text-editors). 

If you have questions about how to use GitHub, _ask_! We were all new users not so long ago, and would love to help you get set up. 

Once you're all set up, look through some of the lab's repositories[^3] to see how we use GitHub (though if you have ideas for how to do so better, please share! We're all looking to improve).

### 2. Data Files

While GitHub is for scripts, functions, documentation, etc (and communication around those), the lab's **data should not be put on GitHub**. Instead please use the University of Denver's shared secure drive space for all data. There are two drives - the "S" drive and the "R" drive. Please send your DU email to peter.sokol-hessner@du.edu with your name@du.edu address to be added to those drives. Peter will share with you the file sharing addresses for those drives and help you connect to them.

These drives also have some non-GitHub based resources (PDFs of helpful textbooks, etc.).

In order to access the drives from off-campus, you must have the latest, greatest version of the DU VPN installed. See [here](https://www.du.edu/it/services/software/vpn) for more. 

### 3. Google Calendars and Files

The lab uses Google Calendars for all lab-wide events (e.g., lab meetings, important dates) and to coordinate use of the lab's experiment rooms. We also occasionally shares files (including docs or spreadsheets) using Google. Share your Google account username (i.e. accountname@gmail.com) with Peter so he can give you access to the relevant files. 

### 4. Website

The lab website contains brief [profiles of all lab members](www.sokolhessnerlab.com/people). Please send the following to peter.sokol-hessner@du.edu:

- Your **name** and **pronouns** exactly as you would like them to appear on the site.
- A grayscale, professional **profile picture** of yourself. Higher resolution is better. 
- Any **links** you'd like included, like to your email address, website, or profiles (on GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.). 
- (optional) A PDF copy of your **curriculum vitae (CV)**.

It's your responsibility to keep this profile up to date. If anything changes, ask Peter to update the relevant portion of your profile. 

## Lab Space

The lab is located in Room 155 of Frontier Hall (2155 S. Race St.), on the University of Denver campus. Experiment rooms are immediately adjacent to lab. 
- If you are a graduate student, you should have your own set of keys. Contact the department administrators to obtain keys. 
- If you are an undergraduate student, you will use the shared keys kept in a lockbox near the lab. Ask Peter for more information. 

## The SHLab's Research

To familiarize yourself with the kind of research we do and how we do it, you can read published, in press, and pre-print papers from the lab at https://www.sokolhessnerlab.com/publications. Follow your interests, and ask the lab members you're working with (Peter, a graduate student, etc) which in particular they'd recommend.





[^1]: A workspace is a collection of people and topics in Slack. Typically, a workspace is for an organization (like a lab). Workspaces contain multiple channels. 
[^2]: The University of Denver is on an [quarter system](https://www.du.edu/registrar/calendars-deadlines). Each quarter is 10 weeks. 
[^3]: Repositories are for all the files related to one project. See the Start Your Lab [glossary](https://www.startyourlab.com/docs/glossary) for more.
