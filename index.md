# Welcome!

The goal of this document is to **help new lab members get set up** quickly and easily. Note that this website is hosted via GitHub, making it easy for existing lab members to edit and improve upon this document! If you're new, don't worry about that yet - just follow the instructions below to get started. 

## Communication

The lab uses two main ways to communicate, plus a few others. 

### Slack

There are two [Slack](www.slack.com) workspaces[^1] to join. 

The **lab slack** is for most daily communication. The slack workspace has channels for general communication, interesting "good reads" that lab members find, social interactions, research projects (each project has its own channel), direct messages between specific lab members, and more. **To be added to the slack workspace**, email peter.sokol-hessner@du.edu with the email address you'd like to use (typically, your name@du.edu address).

The **DU PSYC Coders Slack** is for people in or affiliated with the DU Psychology department who use programming to conduct their research. The workspace has channels for e.g., `R`, `python`,  `MATLAB`, and more. 

#### Slack Settings

Slack works best when everyone's on it, and people are generally responsive. To this end...

1. If you are an active member of the lab, **please install Slack** and then  **enable notifications** in Slack on your computer and any digital devices (i.e., phone) that you regularly use.
2. Once installed, please **configure your account** with a representative photo of yourself, your full name, your pronouns, a brief blurb about yourself & your lab role, and any other information in the Slack profile that'd be helpful. 

### Email

We have lab email lists, including shlab-general@du.edu and shlab-core@du.edu. To be added to these lists, please send your name@du.edu email to peter.sokol-hessner@du.edu. 

These lists are used for forwarding email announcements, and occasionally for lab events. _shlab-general_ is meant for anyone & everyone within the department of psychology who is interested in things that the S-H Lab may be discussing or doing. _shlab-core_ is meant only for 'core' members of the lab (graduate students, undergraduate RAs, etc).

### Other communication media

Lab members are also generally on [Twitter](www.twitter.com). Lab members are encouraged to join twitter and follow other lab members, and, when applicable, share interesting or relevant tweets they find on science, research, or whatever. 


[^1]: A workspace is a collection of people and topics in Slack. Typically, a workspace is for an organization (like a lab). Workspaces contain multiple channels.
